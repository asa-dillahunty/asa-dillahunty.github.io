			<h2>The Problem?</h2>
			<p>
				One day I was playing Subway Surfers, and I couldn't help but feel that coins were more 
				heavily dispersed amongst the edge rows. Now if you're not familiar with Subway Surfers,
				it's got power-ups, and the one I'm talking about is called a jetpack. The jetpack 
				raises the player above all the obstacles and leaves the players to follow a path of
				coins. These coins transfer between the 3 lanes a player can run in, and one can't help
				but think, <strong>"If I couldn't switch lanes, which one would give me the most coins?"</strong>

				</br></br>

				Are coins equally distributed across all three lanes in Subway Surfer? If one were to deploy a
				jetpack, and could only pick a single lane to remain in for the duration of the jetpack's fuel reserves,
				which lane would a clever man choose? What statistical methods might that wise woman employ to make
				such a determination? I set out seeking the source of this wisdom, and found Master Markov. It is 
				his chains that guide me now through <strong>The Subway.</strong>

				</br></br>

				Now, Markov Chains are a way to calculate probability for things that don't stop.
				Basically, one takes a representation of the movement between states as a matrix
				transformation and performs an integral on it, I think. I've never taken a 
				statistics course.

				</br></br>

				This is the initial matrix we set up, and when performing the integration we get
				these three equations: </br>

				0.33 (1 - P) + 0.33 Q </br>
				0.66 P + 0.33 (1 - 2 Q) </br>
				0.33 (1 - P) + 0.33 Q </br>

				</br>

				Which simplifies to P=Q. Underwhelmingly

			</p>

			<h2>Simulating data with set P and Q</h2>
			<p>
				By default P and Q are set as close to 1/3 as possible. Soon I will update this to allow N to change. N is the number of 'lanes' in the problem.
